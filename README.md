# EStar Takee1 Device Tree

Can be made by extracting some files from a device tree of a similar device on Github, or extracting some files from the stock ROM. (in this case I think we'll have to use the Kitkat ROM (Luckas) with 3.4.67 kernel, since the stock ROM has a 3.4.39 kernel but Android 7 requires 3.4.67).
